      <p>Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy as it applies to the Maine State of Learning Website ("MSOL Website" or "our website" or "our site") provided by Breakwater Learning ("Breakwater" or "we" or "us") in partnership with Badge Labs.</p>

      <p><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>

      <p>When you access the MSOL Website we may collect two types of information from you: (1) personal information that identifies you such as your name or email address ("Personal Information"); and (2) non-personal technical information such as your IP address, browser or device information, and referring site information ("Technical Data").</p>

      <p>We collect Personal Information when you voluntarily submit it to us by signing up for an account. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information to provide. We may also collect Personal Information when you provide feedback or comments, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>

      <p>We collect Technical Data via automated technologies whenever you visit the MSOL Website. 
For example, your browser automatically collects and transmits certain information to any website you visit, including ours. Depending on what browser you use, and your browser settings, that could include your IP Address, your browser type, language preferences, geographical information, the site you visited immediately prior to visiting the MSOL Website, and more.</p>

  <p>Also, we may send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser, whether or not you are logged in to the site. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to remember your preferences when you return to the site. We do so by gathering aggregate data about how people use our site. This is also called "web analytics" and cookies and and other technologies like clear gifs are tools by which a website owner collects web analytics data. We use this Technical Data primarily to assist us in diagnosing technical problems, providing you with a great user experience, and defending against attacks on the site. We also use the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better understanding of how MSOL Website visitors use the site, and to facilitate those visitors’ interactions with our site. We may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.</p>

  <p>We will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our websites as described above. We will do this by using either our own internal analytics software or by sending this information to a third-party service provider to help us analyze this data.</p>

  <p>Note: When content or Services are embedded on the MSOL Website by third parties, those providers may collect information about you and use it in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Breakwater cannot vouch for those policies or how they are implemented.</p>

  <p><strong>Children</strong></p>

  <p>The MSOL Website is specifically directed to individuals including children under the age of thirteen (13). We take special precautions with regard to information we collect from minors under 13 in accordance with federal law. Specifically, we require that such individuals provide verifiable parental consent before using our site.</p>

  <p>Certain activities on the MSOL Website allow children to post Personal Information (e.g., name, email address, physical location) that will be accessible to other MSOL members. We are not responsible for what other MSOL Members may do with that information. As such, we strongly urge parents and guardians to supervise their children when they use the MSOL Website.</p>

  <p>If we have collected and stored Personal Information from a child, we will give parents the ability to review their child's Personal Information, request that we discontinue further collection or use of their child's Personal Information, and/or request that we delete their child's personal information. If you have a request regarding your child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@mainestateoflearning.org">help@mainestateoflearning.org</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Protection and Sharing of Personal Information</strong></p>

  <p>Where Breakwater has collected Personal Information, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers, Sister and Partner Agencies and research partners that need to know that information in order to process it on Breakwater’s behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others. By using our site, you consent to the transfer of your information to them. We will retain any personally identifying information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. We do not rent or sell personally identifying information to anyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>

  <p>The MSOL Website protects personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at your own risk, and you are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as keeping your password secret).</p>

  <p><strong>Updating Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personally identifiable information or potentially personally identifiable information, as permitted by law. Breakwater will seek to comply with such requests, provided that we have sufficient information to identify the Personal Information or Technical Data related to you. You may make a request by contacting us at <a href="mailto:help@mainestateoflearning.org">help@mainestateoflearning.org</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>What Happens if I Don't Want to Provide my Personal Information?</strong></p>

  <p>If you do not want to submit Personal Information that is necessary to provide the service or to fulfill your request, you will not be able to access and/or participate in certain activities. For example, you will not be able to register on this website or earn badges. In addition, your refusal to submit Personal Information may limit our ability to respond to your customer support inquiry in a timely fashion.</p>

  <p><strong>Legal Process and Other Disclosures</strong></p>

  <p>While MSOL Website endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; or (3) or to protect the rights, property or safety of Breakwater, its users or the public.</p>

  <p>Consistent with our privacy commitments, we will scrutinize third party requests for information about you for compliance with the law, including those coming from governmental agencies or civil litigants. We will provide notice of legal process or governmental requests unless prohibited to do so by law or the circumstances warrant otherwise. In addition, we may independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.</p>

  <p><strong>Links to Third Party Websites</strong></p>

  <p>We may include links on this site for your use and reference, including to badge issuers’ websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>

  <p>By using the MSOL Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the MSOL Website. We may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on the MSOL Website before the changes take effect.</p>
